# electrode-keepalive

`electrode-keepalive` provides an HttpAgent capable of maintaining available sockets using IP address instead of hostname lookup. This allows for graceful handling of dns changes/failover when changes occur in routing configuration. This is particularly important when using keep-alive enabled connections.  It resolves part of the problems in this [issue](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/6713)

It also uses the patched [agentkeepalive] to support destorying kept alive sockets within a timeout.

### Usage

```js
const ElectrodeKeepAlive = require("electrode-keepalive");

const opts = {
  keepAlive: true,
  keepAliveMsecs: 30000, // socket send keep alive ping every 30 secs
  maxSockets: 100,
  maxFreeSockets: 10
};

const keepAlive = new ElectrodeKeepAlive(opts);

const dnsOptions = {};

keepAlive.preLookup("www.google.com", dnsOptions, (err) => {
  request({url: "http://www.google.com", agent: keepAlive.agent});
});
```

> Since this module works by overriding `http.Agent`'s synchronous `getName` method to return the IP instead of hostname, it has to use a pre-populated DNS mapping.  Before the mapping is populated, it can't use IP.  To avoid that in your first request, you should always call the `preLookup` method first.

# APIs

## Properties

### [agent](#agent)

`instance.agent` - Read only instance property to access the http/https agent.

### [https](#https)

`instance.https` - Read only instance property.  If true, then the agent is an https agent.

### [static DNS_CACHE](#static-dns_cache)

`ElectrodeKeepAlive.DNS_CACHE` - Internal DNS mapping object.

## Methods

### [constructor](#constructor)

`constructor(options)`

Creates an instance of `ElectrodeKeepAlive`.

-   `options` should be the default http agent [settings] that are passed through to the underlying implementation. Additionally the following options are supported:

    -   `https` - If true, then creates an https Agent.
    -   `expiry` - The duration (in milliseconds) that ip entries in the DNS mapping will be refreshed. **Default**: `5000ms`

    -   `checkExpiredDnsInterval` - interval in milliseconds to check and delete expired DNS cache entries.  **Default**: `10000ms`

    -   Since this uses [agentkeepalive], you can also pass in any options it supports.
    -   The defaults for the following two options are set if you didn't specify them:
        -   `freeSocketKeepAliveTimeout` - `30000ms`
        -   `timeout` - `60000ms`

### [preLookup](#prelookup)

`instance.preLookup(host, options, callback)`

Allows `ElectrodeKeepAlive` to do a DNS lookup on the host first to populate its DNS mapping.  

The arguments matches Node dns module lookup.

### [clearDnsCache](#cleardnscache)

`instance.clearDnsCache()` - Wipes out current DNS mapping.

### [getName](#getname)

`instance.getName(options)`

The internal method to override http agent's default `getName`.  Not intended for public use.
